<h1 align='center'>Hey there ðŸ‘‹,</h1>

I'm George Hua. Over the past 4 years, I've gained valuable entrepreneurial experience, working to bridge the diverse needs of various individuals. I've also honed my skills as a software developer, crafting high-quality programs that align with business requirements. However, my true calling emerged when I discovered my passion for data analytics, which allows me to tackle real-world challenges through quantitative analysis. My primary areas of focus are data analytics, machine learning, and natural language processing, where I'm dedicated to making a meaningful impact on society and the business world.

In my free time, I'm an avid enthusiast of science fiction narratives. Exploring these imaginative worlds is not only an adventure but also a constant source of inspiration for me. My all-time favorite sci-fi movie is "2001: A Space Odyssey," where the iconic line "It's full of stars" serves as a reminder of the boundless possibilities that lie ahead. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
