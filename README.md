<h1 align='center'>Hey there ðŸ‘‹,</h1>

I'm George Hua, a recent graduate from the University of Toronto, specializing in data science. have a background in social science and data science, and enthusiastic about solving real-world challenges with data-driven approaches. 

In my leisure time, I'm a big fan of science fiction stories. For me, exploring the imagined world is adventurous and always the source of creativity. My favorite sci-fi movie is *2001: A Space Odyssey* ("My God, it's full of stars."ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ)
