I'm George Hua, an aspiring Data Scientist, Web Developer, and Entrepreneur.

I have a background in social science and data science. I enjoy solving real-world challenges with data-driven analysis. 

In my leisure time, I'm a big fan of science fiction stories. For me, exploring the imagined world is adventurous and always the source of creativity. My favorite sci-fi movie is *2001: A Space Odyssey*



**Highlighted Works:**

I created a text-to-speech app that converts academic paper to MP3 audio, and used machine learning models to filter suitable texts for reading aloud.

I co-founded a research institute dedicated to traffic and transportation study. I worked in the role of web developer and research assistant.
